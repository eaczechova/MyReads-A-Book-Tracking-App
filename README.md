# MyReads Project

## About

Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree project in which I have created a bookshelf app that allows user to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that you will use to persist information as you interact with the application.

## Installation

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
* run http://localhost:3000/ to open the app
